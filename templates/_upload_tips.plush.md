### Tips

Use a **short and descriptive** title

* Add **labels** to make it easier for people to find your blueprints
* Let people know what **inputs/outputs** the belts of your blueprints should have by adding a constant combinator with the relevant signal(s), and using filter inserters for showing what inserters are expected to pick up
* **Calculate and describe** the inputs and outputs of the blueprints (e.g.: `Tileable Red Science - 1.5 science per second per tile, input 1.5 copper & 3 iron per second per tile`)
* If you are submitting a Blueprint Book from which multiple blueprints have to be combined, make sure to describe how they should be set up to work together
* Feel free to include external links for more information, to the [Factorio Calculator](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io) for example.
