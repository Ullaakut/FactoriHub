## How to setup

Ever on the search for a better mall, I decided to experiment with some new designs. This is the divine spaghetti I ended up with.  I wanted something that looked cool, was
relatively compact, had all products easily accessible on foot, had as many of the final assemblers as possible externally facing, and didn't want to use any sushi or logistics
bots. Efficiency is not this design's strong point. Gears, especially, are a bottleneck. However it will eventually fill all products. Everything is limited to a default of 10. Most products
are inserter gated at their chests, but artillery wagons, flame turrets, and modules are gated by constant combinators near their chests.

I'm considering whether my next project should be a bigger version that includes those items, or a smaller supplementary mall with just those. It is [lighted](google.com) so you can see your
way at night, and it's [quite recognizable on the map](google.com), but the [power situation](google.com) is admittedly a bit of a mess. The walls are there to protect your precious goods from an accidental
run-in with a car or tank.

## Inputs

Constant combinators at the top of the print mark the input belts and pipes. There's an extra set in case you don't want to figure out side-loading belts yourself. Logistics bots
are only required for uranium ammo, uranium shells, and atomic bombs. I decided to include mostly only things I would need large quantities of over the game, so, this design is
missing: Weapons, Vehicles, Personal Equipment. I also noticed, too late, that it's missing flamethrower ammo and rocket silos.
